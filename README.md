# Web PS

Run the powershell command through the browser.
> :warning: This is my funny project.

## Maintenance
I'm going to rewrite the backend **Web PS** in Rust (for learning reason) and change the name **Web PS** to something more appropriate for **(Cross-platform)**, the first time that I created this project I don't know exactly how the process worked, which leads to poor design, If you have any questions please let me know.

# Goal
- Beautiful front-end and easy to use
- Cross-platform
- Security

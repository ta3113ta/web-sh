# Web SH

Run the command through the browser like TTY.
> :warning: This is my funny project.

## Maintenance
I'm going to rewrite the backend **Web PS** in Rust or maybe golang (for learning reason) and change the name **Web PS** to something, the first time that I created this project I don't know exactly how the process worked, which leads to poor design, If you have any questions please let me know.
